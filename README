Azure Storage Tools
===================

Azure Storage Tools (ast) is a set of 3 binaries that perform the common operations on Azure storage accounts. This is NOT for creating of accounts or infrastructure but more about the USING of the
already created infrastructure.

AST is provided for many platforms:  Windows, Linux, OSX , FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD all in x86 and x64 variants. 


Azure Storage Tools: Blob
-------------------------

Azure Storage Tools Blob (astblob) is the tool for use again Azure Blob Storage.
The operations are:

- Upload files
- Download files
- Create container
- List containers
- List blobs in a container

Planned operations are:
- Generate SAS url for blob
- Generate SAS url for container

Example Usage:

Azure account names and account keys can either be passed in by arguments to the executable OR can be set via the environment variables ACCOUNT_NAME and ACCOUNT_KEY.
Assuming they are set via the environment variables, some command are:

astblob -createcontainer -container temp

This will create a container with the name "temp"

astblob -container temp -list

This will list the blobs in the container "temp"

astblob -container temp -upload -local c:\temp\myfile.txt

This will upload a local file c:\temp\myfile.txt to the container "temp". This is obviously on the Windows platform. Equally on a *nix system the command would replace c:\temp\myfile.txt with an equivent 
/mypath/myotherpath/file1  etc.
